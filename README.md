## Description

Cross-view image geo-localization is beset with numerous difficulties and challenges, mainly due to the significant discrepancies in viewpoint, the intricacy of localization scenarios, and global localization needs. Given these challenges, we present a novel cross-view image geo-localization framework. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods on multiple public datasets and self-built datasets. 
To improve the cross-view geo-localization performance of the framework on a global scale, we have built a novel global cross-view geo-localization dataset, CV-Cities. This dataset encompassing a diverse range of intricate scenarios. It serves as a challenging benchmark for cross-view geo-localization.

## CV-Cities: Global Dataset for Cross-view Image Geo-localization
We collects 223,736 ground images and 223,736 satellite images with high-precision GPS coordinates of 16 typical cities in five continents.
